# fooderlich

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

In this section, I'm going to start building a complete recipe app called Fooderlich.

I will gain an understanding of the various widgets available in Flutter and use them extensively.

Additionally, I'll learn about the inner workings of widgets and how they function behind the scenes.

 After that, I'll explore layout widgets, scrollable widgets, and interactive widgets in more detail.
